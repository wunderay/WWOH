# What's the Weather Over Here (WWOH)

## Live site: https://wwoh.onrender.com/

A weather web application that gives the user the current weather at their location. WWOH uses the Geolocation APi from [ipbase](https://ipbase.com/) to retrieve the user's geographical location which is then sent to [OpenWeather's](https://openweathermap.org/) Weather API which returns the weather information that is then displayed to the user.
